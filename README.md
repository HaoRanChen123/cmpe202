functional programming
#### (I think)The most different part between functional programming and lambda is the interface, the lambda limited the interface has only one function, and it doesn't matter what's the name of the interface, however the functional programming can have more than one function in each interface and the name should be used as defined. Second, the parameter value in the lambda should be final which means doesn't change.
#### what's more, the lambda don't need return type, or function name, or parameter, even ,if it's only one line it don't need block{}. 
#### so it's a little unclear if you don't add name when you use interface(You have to check signature up and down ), but it can make code more flexiable, and less couple
