## Comparing with Lab1 Code Matainablity
#### The first advantage of Aspect and feature ide come to my mind is they are dynamic, you can config your test first and then go to test.
I mean it's very easy to change the test flow and define the constrains that maybe forget by developer who use Code Matainability. Besides it's 
more clear, because you can see all the function list below, and it's more flexable, bascially you can insert your code everywhere in the program
, you can insert before, after, etc. At the same time you can call the function any where , just like I just mentioned, and Now I understand why
Paul can finish job very quickly and impress his boss or colleague.
